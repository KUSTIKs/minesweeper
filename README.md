This is a classic implementation of the Minesweeper game using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Description

The Minesweeper game features a user authentication system, a menu page with options to navigate to the leaderboard and start a game, and a game page where you can play and interact with the game board. The game allows you to reveal cells, flag potential mines, and provides feedback on neighboring mines. You can also save and load games for later play.
